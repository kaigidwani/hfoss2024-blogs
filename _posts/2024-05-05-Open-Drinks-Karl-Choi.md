# What the project is

Open Drinks is a website that hosts recipes of drinks contributed by the community.
Contributors help by adding new drinks or improvements to the website.

# Why I picked it

1. I thought the concept of the project was pretty fun and interesting

2. The project had good onboarding with a template for contributions

3. It looked like a project that wasn't code intensive and thus something I could feasibly contribute to. 

# Comm Arch Analysis

- The last commit was 4 months ago, so the project isn't that active. However, from the commit history, the maintainer has taken multiple 4-6 month breaks before (over a 5-year period), so the project probably isn't dead.

- There are over 500 contributors.

- The contribution doc was detailed, included a code template, and explained step by step how to contribute.

- The project has a license, readme, and code of conduct.

- There have been over 1300 closed pull requests, so the project does seem to accept many contributions [good for contributors].

# The contribution I picked

Contributions to Open Drinks are mainly new drink recipes, so the contribution I picked was a recipe for Jasmine Milk Tea.

# How I went about pursuing it

I read the contributing doc on the GitHub for what code format I should adhere to when making a new contribution. I then went looking on the internet for a good, reputable, and positively received Jasmine Milk Tea recipe. This was actually harder than I thought it would be, since most of the recipes had very little reviews [5 or less] while others didn't have specific measurements for the ingredients.

In the end, I found a YouTube video with around 11k views, and a good like/dislike ratio. After sifting through the video and comments, I was able to compile a coherent recipe that seemed good and true to the nature of the drink.

I filled out the template that was provided and submitted a pull request which passed all 4 automated checks, so I'm currently waiting for that to be merged. Due to the lack of activity in the server, I don't expect it to be merged anytime soon. However, I do believe it will be merged/seen eventually due to the maintainer activity pattern previously mentioned. There are only 8 open pull requests (including mine) and 1,300+ closed pull requests, so pull requests do seem to be reviewed.
